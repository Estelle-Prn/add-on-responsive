            <h3>Rome, the Eternal City</h3>
            <p>
              The history of Rome includes the history of the city of Rome as
              well as the civilisation of ancient Rome. Roman history has been
              influential on the modern world, especially in the history of the
              Catholic Church, and Roman law has influenced many modern legal
              systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              Attempts have been made to find a linguistic root for the name
              Rome. Possibilities include derivation from the Greek Rhṓmē
              (Ῥώμη), meaning « bravery » or « courage ». Compare also Rumon,
              former name of the Tiber River. Its further etymology remains
              unknown, as with most Etruscan words. Thomas G. Tucker's Concise
              Etymological Dictionary of Latin (1931) suggests that the name is
              most probably from
              <em>urobsma</em>
              and otherwise, « but less likely » from <em>urosma</em> « hill ».
