            <h3>Why Rome ?</h3>
            <h2>Rome, the Eternal City</h2>
            <p>
              Rome is the capital city and most populated comune (municipality)
              of Italy. It is also the administrative centre of the Lazio region
              and of the Metropolitan City of Rome. A special comune named Roma
              Capitale with 2,746,984 residents in 1,287.36 km2, Rome is the
              third most populous city in the European Union by population
              within city limits.
              <br />
              <br />
              Vatican City (the smallest country in the world and headquarters
              of the worldwide Catholic Church under the governance of the Holy
              See) is an independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome,
              the only existing example of a country within a city. Rome is
              often referred to as the City of Seven Hills due to its geography,
              and also as the « Eternal City ».
              <br />
              Rome is generally considered to be one of the cradles of Western
              civilization and Western Christian culture, and the centre of the
              Catholic Church.
